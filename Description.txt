####################### Description of project for Data Engineering and Distributed Information Systems #####################
The idea for application is to implement simply chat application using Ruby on Rails for server side, and probably Ember.js for client side. 
Application will have a two behaviors, for now. First behavior is communication between two peoples, and the second in is group chat. 
For design part, I am not sure yet but I will explore a little bit about it. That it is for now. I will keep updating this file.
